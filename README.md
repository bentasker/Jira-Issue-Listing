Jira-Issue-Listing
==================

I use a private install of JIRA on my network, but also use the [Sphider search engine](http://www.sphider.eu/ "Sphider a PHP spider and Search Engine") to index everything. Unfortunately as has no understanding of authentication it cannot index JIRA issues unless the projects are marked as public. 

This was originally a small script to generate pages for Sphider to index, with the resulting links redirecting 'real' users to the relevant page on JIRA. There's a lot more to it now, and the documentation needs to be updated, though the script will now allow you to create a static HTML mirror of some (or all) projects within your JIRA install, for use as a fallback or display on the net.

Most of the script should be self explanatory, but for some outdated documentation, see http://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/development-programming/273-allowing-your-internal-search-engine-to-index-jira-issues




Issue Tracking
-----------------

You are welcome to raise issues within GitHub, however I track the project within JIRA itself. A static HTML mirror of the issue tracking can be viewed at http://projects.bentasker.co.uk/jira_projects/browse/JILS.html
