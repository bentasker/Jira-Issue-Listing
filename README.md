Jira-Issue-Listing
==================

I use a private install of JIRA on my network, but also use the [Sphider search engine](http://www.sphider.eu/ "Sphider a PHP spider and Search Engine") to index everything. Unfortunately as has no understanding of authentication it cannot index JIRA issues unless the projects are marked as public. 

This small script generates pages for Sphider to index, and the resulting links will redirect 'real' users to the relevant page on JIRA.

Most of the script should be self explanatory, but for full documentation, see http://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/development-programming/273-allowing-your-internal-search-engine-to-index-jira-issues
